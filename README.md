Lo-fi_mood.fm is my personal take on a mood-based lo-fi playlist curator and generator that uses natural language processing to recommend personalized YouTube playlists based on your emotional state.

How it works
Users input a short text description of how they're feeling.

A fine-tuned RoBERTa model from Hugging Face Transformers analyzes the emotional tone (e.g., sad, happy).

Additional keyword parsing refines the mood context (e.g., sleepy, glee, study, chill).

Based on the detected emotion and mood, the system selects tracks from a curated dataset of 3,500+ lo-fi YouTube songs.

Features
Frontend: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript, responsive and animated UI

Backend (optional): FastAPI with RoBERTa-based emotion analysis

Docker support for full deployment

Real-time playlist generation with mood tagging

Input example:
"Feeling anxious and need something calm to work with" â†’ Generates a chill, focus-driven lo-fi mix
