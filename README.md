Built with a blend of frontend aesthetics and AI-powered backend mood analysis, it's designed for chill vibes, study sessions, or just vibing. 
Features include mood analysis from freeform text input, curated lo-fi playlists from a YouTube song database, a clean animated UI with a pure HTML/CSS/JS frontend. It‚Äôs Docker-ready and optionally supports a Python backend. 
To get started, clone the repo (git clone https://github.com/Teejay2424/lo-fi_mood.fm.git) and open index.html in your browser.

The project includes an index.html, optional backend (app.py), and a Dockerfile. Input examples like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling sleepy and want something chill to listen to while studying‚Äù generate tailored lo-fi mixes.
