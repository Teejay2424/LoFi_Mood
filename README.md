# Lo-fi_mood.fm

**Lo-fi_mood.fm** is my personal take on a mood-based lo-fi playlist curator generator that uses natural language processing to recommend songs, for you personally based on your text input!


## How it works

- Users input a short text description of how they're feeling.
- A fine-tuned **RoBERTa** model from **Hugging Face Transformers** analyzes the emotional tone (e.g., feeling down, glee).
- Additional keyword parsing refines the mood context (e.g., sleepy, nostalgic, study, chill).
- Based on the detected emotion and mood, the system selects tracks from a curated dataset of **3,500+ lo-fi YouTube beats**.

## Features

- Frontend: Pure **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**, responsive and animated UI
- Backend (optional): **FastAPI** with **RoBERTa-based emotion analysis**
- Docker support for full deployment
- Real-time playlist generation with mood tagging
- Input example:  
  _"Feeling anxious and need something calm to work with"_ â†’ Generates a chill, focus-driven lo-fi mix
